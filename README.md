# Module 5 Final Project


For this project I used a dataset from Rent the Runway containing over 190,000 customer reviews, including customer body measurements. Rent the Runway is an online retailer focused on renting clothes and accessories. It is a subscription based service. As such, it is vital to maintain customer satisfaction. 

I will use machine learning models to predict if a customer will rate an item as a 10 given the information about the customer's body (height, weight, size, and body type). I will also use data analysis to identify gaps in inventory and underserved demographics. 

I tested decision trees, random forest models, adaboost models, and gradient boosted tree models. To deal with class imbalance, I used the SMOTE method. 

My results had 61% accuracy in predicting a rating of 10 using a Gradient Boosted Tree Model. I also found that the company could benefit from investing in larger sizes and focusing marketing tactics on customers in their 20s.
